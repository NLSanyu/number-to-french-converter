# Kata - Number to french converter

### Overview
Numbers can be hard to write in French, so this project implements an algorithm to convert numbers from digits to their written version in French.

### Project set up
- Clone the project and change directory into the project folder: `cd number-to-french-converter`
- Within the root project folder, create a virtual environment: `python3 -m virtualenv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (there are no requirements for now, since no external modules or libraries were used, but they could be added in future interations of the code)
- Run the `converter.py` file: `python converter.py`
